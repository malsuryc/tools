# Tools

I got tired of paywalls, forced sign-ups, and broken Figma plugins, so I made these tools to make my life easier.

Use them as you wish.

## Usage

Each tool is a standalone HTML file with no complex dependecies, just download and run, or use these tools directly in your browser without downloading: [Tools](https://malsuryc.github.io/tools/ "https://malsuryc.github.io/tools/")

## Contributing

These are mostly personal scripts, so just fork it and adjust by your own. But if you find a bug or have an idea for a lightweight tool, open an issue or submit a pull request will be cool.
